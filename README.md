# SmartPay

SmartPay was created as part of Google Andela scholarship program
challenge 2.0.
SmartPay validates online payments via credit cards: it checks the cards: type, expiry date, holder's name 
and validates the digits with luhn function and flags invalid any invalid values entered into the app.
It also enables smart typing.
